        **Before You Start...**

        This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        - Read the [docs](https://helldivers-2.fly.dev/swagger-ui.html)
        - Ask on [Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/E8UUfWYmf9)
        - Ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/helldivers-2/api/discussions)

        Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
        you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.

    attributes:
      label: Link to faulty endpoint

        Provide a link to the endpoint that is malfunctioning.

        Please do not just fill in a random link. The issue will be closed if no valid reproduction is provided.

        This helps us identifying the errors in our logs that are related to the problem you are reporting.
        For websites that access the API directly you should put the domain of your website here, if you are writing
        a server side application (aka an API, Discord bot or if your website only accesses the API server side) put
        the name of the application here that it reports in the `User-Agent` header.
      placeholder: Client name

        Provide as much information about your request as you can.
        If you are accessing the API from the browser you can right click the request in the network tab of your devtools
        see [this link](https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/copyas.html) for more information on how to do this in your
        browser.
  
        If you are writing a server side application include all headers and the URL you are sending, in case of doubt
        feel free to put the code you use to call the API here.
