# Running in a container

It is possible to self-host the API by either running it directly or by running it as a container.
This allows you to access the API in secured networks (although you'll still need to
be able to access the ArrowHead API endpoints of course), or to run an instance
with modified settings (such as rate limits).

### Building the container
First make sure you have cloned the repository:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/helldivers-2/api.git
```

Then build the container so it's ready for local use (run this *inside* the cloned folder):
```shell
docker build -f ./src/Helldivers-2-API/Dockerfile -t helldivers2-api .
```

and finally run the image:
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 helldivers2-api
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you get an error message when starting the container similar `System.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null. (Parameter 's')`
> read the section below about [Configuring API keys for the self-hosted version](#configuring-api-keys-for-the-self-hosted-version).
> You can read more details on this [here](https://github.com/helldivers-2/api/issues/90)

### Building the container with OpenAPI
By default, the OpenAPI specifications aren't bundled in the container image.
You can enable OpenAPI support by building the container with these flags:
```shell
docker build --build-arg="OPENAPI=true" -f ./src/Helldivers-2-API/Dockerfile -t helldivers2-api .
```

### Customizing the runtime of the API
Other settings, such as rate limits, features, ... can be customized at runtime
and don't need to be defined at build time of the container.

For a **full** list of options that can be customized, please inspect
[appsettings.json](https://github.com/helldivers-2/api/blob/master/src/Helldivers-2-API/appsettings.json) as all these settings can be overriden.

For example, the `appsettings.json` configuration contains a key like this:
```json
{
  // omitted for brevity
  "Helldivers": {
    "Synchronization": {
      "IntervalSeconds": 20,
      // omitted for brevity
  }
}
```
The `IntervalSeconds` defines the rate at which the API will synchronize with ArrowHead's
API endpoints, in this example it will synchronize every `20` seconds.
Let's say we want to update this in our own container to run every `10` seconds instead.

We can do this by defining an environment variable that overrides the configuration defined
in `appsettings.json`.
in this case the property we're overriding is set under
`Helldivers:Synchronization:IntervalSeconds`, so we need to declare a variable called
`Helldivers__Synchronization__IntervalSeconds` with value `10`

You can define environment variables for your container like this:
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "Helldivers__Synchronization__IntervalSeconds=10" helldivers2-api
```

You can read more about using environment variables to override configuration [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-8.0#naming-of-environment-variables)

### Configuring API keys for the self-hosted version
The API ships with an API key mechanism that allows you to generate API keys that can override the specified rate limits.
This feature is enabled by default, but requires a valid signing key to generate and validate API keys.

For security reasons we don't ship default API keys (as that would open anyone who forgets to change them to DDOS attacks).
If you don't want to bother with API keys (for example because you configured your own rate limits as shown [below](#overriding-rate-limits))
you can disable them by passing the following parameter to your Docker run command:
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "Helldivers__API__Authentication__Enabled=false" helldivers2-api
```
If you'd like to enable API keys, you'll have to set a signing key. It's *required* this key is 32 bits and formatted as
base 64 (for examples in a couple languages see [Generating an API signing key](#generating-an-api-signing-key)).

Once you have your signing key, pass it to the container using the `Helldivers__API__Authentication__SigningKey` variable:
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "Helldivers__API__Authentication__SigningKey=YourSigningKey" helldivers2-api
```

### Generating an API signing key
Elixir
```elixir
32
|> :crypto.strong_rand_bytes()
|> Base.encode64()
```

### Generating an API key
When you run the API locally (*not in a container*) you have access to an extra endpoint: `/dev/token`.
This endpoint generates an API key that you can use to make requests to any API instance that has the same signing key.

It takes 2 parameters:
- `name` which is the name of the client for which you are generating a token (it's used for metrics and logging).
- `limit` this is the new rate limit that will be set when the API key is used

for example: `/dev/token?name=dealloc&limit=999` will generate an API token for a client called `dealloc` that can make `999` requests per time window.

> [!WARNING]
> This endpoint **requires** a valid signing key to be configured, if you don't have one see [Configuring API keys for the self-hosted version](#configuring-api-keys-for-the-self-hosted-version)

### Overriding rate limits
You can override the rate limits by overriding the following configuration:
```json
{
  "Helldivers": {
    "API": {
      "RateLimit": 5,
      "RateLimitWindow": 10
    }
  }
}
```

The `RateLimit` (overridable with `-e Helldivers__API__RateLimit`) is how many requests can be made in the timeframe,
the `RateLimitWindow` (overridable with `-e Helldivers__API__RateLimitWindow`) is how many seconds before the `RateLimit`
resets again.

Increasing the `RateLimit`, decreasing the `RateLimitWindow` or both will effectively increase how many requests you can
make to the application.

Alternatively, if you use the hosted versions you can request an API key that allows for higher rate limits
by sponsoring this project! (if you self-host you can generate your own keys too!).
